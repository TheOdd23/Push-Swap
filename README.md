# push_swap

The goal of this project was to make a sorting algorithm that takes as less actions as possible to sort every number received in arguments.

This project made us understand the use of linked lists and how each node interacts with each other.

This is a project i'm really proud of because I believe I made a pretty efficient algorithm even though I never made one before.

The bonus part was to create a checker that verifies if the result of the given numbers and actions is good (aka sorted).

These are the basic rules of this project:

This is a simple example (the numbers in the example are the indexes of the numbers passed as arguments):
